## Project

luci-app-trafficctl — OpenWrt LuCI plugin for real-time traffic monitoring and per-device control (block, rate-limit, shape, WiFi deny).

## Target Platform

- OpenWrt 23.x (kernel 5.15+)
- Router: 192.168.0.1, shell is **fish** (use `ssh root@192.168.0.1 sh -c '"command"'` or pipe via stdin)
- Firewall: fw4 / nftables (with iptables fallback detection)
- Shell scripts: POSIX sh / dash (NOT bash) — no arrays, no `[[`, no `<<<`
- BusyBox utilities (limited awk, no gawk features like match() with arrays)

## Directory Structure

All package files live under `luci-app-trafficctl/` (feed-compatible layout — required for
`./scripts/feeds update` to pick up the Makefile, which uses `-mindepth 1`).

## JavaScript Conventions

- **ES5 only** — no `let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring
- `var` everywhere, `function` keyword only
- LuCI globals available: `E()`, `_()`, `L`, `view`, `rpc`, `dom`, `ui`, `form`, `fs`
- `rpc.declare()` for ubus calls
- ESLint config: `.eslintrc.json` (no-var: off, prefer-const: off)
- Run `node --check status.js` for syntax validation

## Shell Script Conventions

- Shebang: `#!/bin/sh`
- All scripts output JSON to stdout
- rpcd scripts (`luci-app-trafficctl/root/usr/libexec/rpcd/trafficctl`) must output JSON **objects** (not bare arrays) — wrap with `{"result": ...}`
- Validate IPs with `tctl_validate_ip` from trafficctl-fw.sh
- Use `2>/dev/null` on commands that may fail (nft, tc, iptables)
- Filter `dig` output: `grep -v '^;;'` to remove error messages

## Releases & Changelog

Releases are **fully automatic**: any `feat:` or `fix:` commit merged to `main` triggers version bump, tag, GitHub Release, and IPK build via `auto-release.yml`.

**Commit message format (Conventional Commits):**

```
feat: add per-device DNS override
fix: handle empty chat_id in telegram bot
ci: add aarch64 compat test
refactor: extract rate-limit validation to helper
docs: update install instructions
chore: bump ESLint config
```

- `feat:` → minor version bump (1.2.0 → 1.3.0)
- `fix:` / `perf:` / `refactor:` / `ci:` → patch version bump (1.3.0 → 1.3.1)
- `feat!:` or `fix!:` (with `!`) → major version bump
- `docs:`, `chore:`, `style:` → no release

**Flow:** merge to main → CI passes → auto-release creates tag + release + IPK. No manual steps.

**Manual trigger:** `auto-release.yml` also supports `workflow_dispatch` to re-run.

## Deployment

scp does NOT work to the router. Deploy files like this:

```sh
ssh root@192.168.0.1 sh -c '"cat > /path/to/file"' < local/file
# For scripts, also chmod:
ssh root@192.168.0.1 sh -c '"cat > /usr/local/bin/script.sh && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/script.sh"' < luci-app-trafficctl/root/usr/local/bin/script.sh
# Frontend:
ssh root@192.168.0.1 sh -c '"cat > /www/luci-static/resources/view/trafficctl/status.js"' < luci-app-trafficctl/htdocs/luci-static/resources/view/trafficctl/status.js
ssh root@192.168.0.1 sh -c '"cat > /www/luci-static/resources/view/trafficctl/status.css"' < luci-app-trafficctl/htdocs/luci-static/resources/view/trafficctl/status.css
```

## Key Technical Details

- Traffic data comes from `/proc/net/nf_conntrack` (conntrack parsing)
- Monitored sources = connected LAN subnets + subnets routed via a LAN next-hop (downstream routers) + `trafficctl.main.extra_subnets` (optional CIDRs); independently, any flow SNAT/masqueraded by this router (reply dst ≠ original src) is picked up as a forwarded client with zero config. Such devices get `conn_type: "routed"`.
- WiFi detection: `iw dev <iface> station dump` → list of connected MACs
- WiFi MAC filter: `hostapd_cli deny_acl ADD_MAC` + `deauthenticate` (no wifi reload)
- Limit targets may be a host, a CIDR (`10.0.20.0/24`), or `all`. Mode `each` (default for any block wider than /32) gives every address its own bucket via an nft `meter` keyed by address; `shared` caps the block in aggregate — a shared cap lets one device starve the rest, hence the default
- Limits and shapes are **bidirectional**: the limiter polices download at WAN ingress (`ip daddr`, chain `dl`) and upload at LAN ingress (`ip saddr`, one `ul_<dev>` chain per device). **A netdev ingress hook bound to a bridge never sees bridged traffic** — packets are received on the bridge's ports — so `tctl_ingress_devices` expands bridges to their `brif/*` ports; hooking `br-lan` matches nothing and looks like a silently ineffective limit (`TCTL_SYSFS_NET` overrides the sysfs root for tests); the shaper builds a matching HTB class on the LAN device (`match ip dst`, download) and on an **IFB device** fed by `mirred` from LAN-side ingress (`match ip src`, upload). Upload must NOT be shaped at WAN egress: POSTROUTING has already masqueraded the source to the router's WAN address there, so a per-client src filter matches nothing. Needs `kmod-ifb`; without it the shaper applies download only and says so. Policing upload on the way *in* is what makes it work for routed/downstream clients. Both halves must be removed together
- tc/HTB shaping: classid derived from IP octets (`1:<hex(o3*256+o4)>`)
- Reserved HTB classids: `1:1` (root), `1:fffe` (default) — skip these
- Burst calculation for tc: `rate_kbit * 125 / 100` (10ms of data, min 1600 bytes)
- Persistent shapes stored in `/etc/trafficctl/shapes.json`
- Persistent blocks/ratelimits stored in `/etc/trafficctl/rules.json` (when `persist_rules` enabled)
- Note: Only `/etc/config/trafficctl` is tracked as a conffile for package upgrades; runtime JSON files are non-essential and can be regenerated
- Port-forward control: own nft table `inet tctl_pfw`, chains at forward/input priority -190 (post-DNAT, before the flowtable offload rule); pause = drop rule + conntrack flush, limit = `limit rate over` drop. Rule comments `tctl_pfw_<pause|limit>_<proto>_<ip|local>_<port>` are the source of truth for state
- Device names: manual alias (`/etc/trafficctl/names`) > DHCP lease > cached reverse DNS. Routed devices have no lease here, so PTR (or an alias) is their only name source; `trafficctl.main.rdns_server` is a space-separated resolver list tried before the system resolver — point it at the downstream router. Lookups never block a poll: the summary reads the cache and spawns `trafficctl-rdns-refresh.sh` detached (max 8 IPs/poll, TTL `rdns_ttl`, `-` = negative cache)
- Netifyd (DPI) integration is optional and inert unless the agent is installed and its socket exists: **Agent v5's `netifyd.sock` is a request/response API that never streams flows** — telemetry comes from the socket SINK (`netify-sink-socket.json`, typically `tcp://127.0.0.1:1780`), auto-detected by `netify_endpoint`. The payload is the aggregator's `{"stats":[…]}` form (`application_id` = `"<id>.netify.<app>"`, separate `download`/`upload`); raw per-flow records are still handled for v4. `trafficctl-netify.sh collect` samples it into `/tmp/trafficctl_netify.json`, which the summary reads for the per-device `app` field and refreshes detached when older than `netify_interval`. Agent framing is undocumented, so flow records are parsed by field extraction (tolerant of newline-delimited and length-prefixed output) and totals are tracked per flow `digest` — the agent re-emits growing counters, so summing every sighting would multiply-count. Set `TCTL_NETIFY_FEED` to a recorded file to test without a socket
- Speed measurement: conntrack bytes (BEFORE tc shaper), so reported speed may exceed shaped limit
- Spike filter: cap speed at 125 MB/s (1 Gbit/s), discard anomalous samples
- Y-axis scaling: 98th percentile, nice ticks (multiples of 100/500 Kbit/s, min 5 gridlines)
- Speed units: ×1000 (SI network convention), not ×1024

## CSS / JS Display Gotcha

Elements hidden via a **CSS class** (`display:none` in `.tm-search-dropdown`, `.tm-search-clear`, `.tm-graph-popup`, `.tm-settings-body`, etc.) must be shown with an **explicit value** like `style.display = 'block'` (or `'inline'`, `'flex'`).  
Setting `style.display = ''` removes the inline override and lets the CSS class re-hide the element — it does **not** show it.

Elements hidden with an **inline style** (`style="display:none"` in the `E()` call) work the opposite way: `style.display = ''` correctly removes the inline style and the element becomes visible.

## UI Design Principles

- Colorblind-safe: blue-orange contrast (no red-green reliance)
- Inline pickers (mkInlinePick) instead of `<select>` for settings
- Settings panel collapsed by default (user expands on demand)
- Pointer cursor on interactive elements
- iOS-style toggles for boolean options
- Chip/pill style for column visibility toggles
- Recent devices quick-access bar (localStorage, MRU order, max 6, stores `{ip,name}`)
- Device picker (`searchSelect`) is seeded from DHCP leases at render time but must be kept current via `searchSelect.updateDevices(rows)` after each `callTrafficctl()` poll — otherwise only DHCP-known devices appear
- Command palette style search (filter by name/IP/MAC)
- Interactive graph popup on sparkline hover (crosshair, DL+UL, gradient fill, limit line)
- `fmtSpeed()`: no ".0" for whole numbers, SI units (×1000)

## Capture Script (docs/capture.js)

- Playwright (Chromium CDP on port 9222)
- Auto-masks MACs (`XX:XX:XX:XX`) and router hostname (`router.local`)
- Prefers Eugene-Asus / vivo-X200 as test targets
- Uses `clickApply()` (DOM evaluate) to bypass Playwright visibility limitations
- `ffmpeg` for GIF generation from frame sequences
